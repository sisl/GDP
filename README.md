# GDP

This directory contains a Markov Decision Process model for the Single Airport Ground Holding Problem (SAGHP) and three solution approaches- one based on approximate dynamic programming, the Ball et al. model, and the Richetta-Odoni dynamic model. This code is intended as a supplement to the article, "Ground Delay Program Planning using Markov Decision Processes" by Jonathan Cox and Mykel J. Kochenderfer, submitted to the Journal of Aerospace Information Systems.

### Run the models
The files in the examples directory simulate each model for one day at a single airport. The output is the sum of rewards for one simulation using landing capacities randomly generated by the [AAR Distribution Prediction Model (ADPM)](https://github.com/sisl/ADPM). The choice of airport, delay costs, and model-specific parameters can be set in adp.jl, ball.jl, and ro.jl.

To run a simulation, cd to the examples directory and execute a file. The file adp.jl uses approximate dynamic programming to choose actions, the file ball.jl uses the Ball et al. model, and the file adp.jl uses the Richetta-Odoni dynamic model. The simulation may take several minutes to run. When the simulation completes, the sum of rewards will be printed to the screen.
