# GDP

This directory contains a Markov Decision Process model for the Single Airport Ground Holding Problem (SAGHP) and two solution approaches- an approach based on approximate dynamic programming and the Ball et al. model. This code is intended as a supplement to the article, "Ground Delay Program Planning using Markov Decision Processes" by Jonathan Cox and Mykel J. Kochenderfer, submitted to the Journal of Aerospace Information Systems.

### Run the models
The files in the examples directory simulate each model for one day at a single airport. The output is the sum of rewards for one simulation with landing capacities randomly generated by the AAR Distribution Prediction Model (ADPM). The choice of airport, delay costs, and model-specific parameters can be set in adp.jl and ball.jl.

To run a simulation, cd to the examples directory and execute a file. The file adp.jl uses approximate dynamic programming to choose actions and the file ball.jl uses the Ball et al. model. The simulation may take several minutes to run. When the simulation completes, the sum of rewards will be printed to the screen.

```
